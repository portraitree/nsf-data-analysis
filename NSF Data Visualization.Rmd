### Author's Note: 
This file is the second half of my work from the Fall 2023 Early Undergraduate Research in Statistics course (36-297). My goal with this .Rmd file was to create an animated time-series choropleth map of the cleaned NSF data (see the NSF Data Cleaning file). I wasn't quite able to successfully accomplish the animation by the end of the semester, but did manage to create the choropleth maps for Baccalaureate Institutions. The following file is less polished, and is essentially my exploration and debugging process. I would enthusiastically invite anyone to use this file as a jumping-off point to animate those Baccalaureate Institution maps, and to adapt the code to visualize the Current Institutions of grant awardees. Much of my code is based off of code from Professor Spencer Koerner's Statistical Graphics & Visualization course (36-315). 


```{r}
# Reading in the cleaned NSF dataset
nsf_done <- read.csv("nsf_fully_cleaned_12-1.csv")

# Reading in data for the choropleth map boundaries
us_data <- map_data("state")
county_data <- map_data("county")
```


```{r}
# Graphing state boundaries
state_borders <- map_data("state") 
head(state_borders)
state_borders %>%
ggplot() + 
    geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), color = "black") 
```

```{r}
# Processing the NSF data to match the state data formats (i.e. abbreviated)
nsf_done$BI_State_Full <- abbr2state(nsf_done$BI_State)
nsf_done$BI_State_Full <- tolower(nsf_done$BI_State_Full)
head(nsf_done)
```

```{r}
